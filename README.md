# Smarthelpdesk
This repository contains a demonstration of a modern help‑desk application powered by large language models. The goal of this project is to show how you can take an existing open‑source chat interface (the excellent [Chatbot UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui)) and extend it with a production‑style backend implemented in Python.
